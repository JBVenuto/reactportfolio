                I have an enthusiastic approach to solving problems with technology. With countless predefined techniques already available and the capacity to creatively solve a problem, I am able to determine the best approach to any issue that comes my way. I am an effective communicator with experience teaching others, organizing group projects and have the ability to succeed working in groups or independently.
