                        <h2>About:</h2>
                        <p>I’m always hearing about new restaurants to check out, but I keep finding myself going to the same few places. To break out of this habit I decided to build an application to track of all these restaurants and to let me make a note of whether or not I would visit again.</p>
                        <h2>Development:</h2>
                        <p>The biggest issue I ran into while developing this application was deploying a react application and a Node.js backend with a MySQL database that were coupled in one project. After reading about different ways to solve this issue such as using the concurrently package, I decided to separate the back-end and front-end into two separate projects that could be deployed on their own.</p>
                        <h2>Tech Used:</h2>
                        <p>The back-end for this application is written with Node.js and uses Express.js to create an API. The MySQL database is hosted on Heroku using the JawsDB plugin. The front-end is built with React.js</p>
